1. Sam wants to select a username in order to register on a website.

The rules for selecting a username are:

1. The minimum length of the username must be 5 characters and the maximum may be 10.
2. It should contain at least one letter from A-Z
3. It should contain at least one digit from 0-9
4. It should contain at least one character from amongst @#*=
5. It should not contain any spaces

Write a program which accepts 4 usernames (one username per line) as input and checks whether each of them satisfy the above mentioned conditions.
If a username satisfies the conditions, the program should print PASS (in uppercase)
If a username fails the conditions, the program should print FAIL (in uppercase)

Suppose the following usernames are supplied to the program:
1234@a
ABC3a#@
1Ac@
ABC 3a#@

Then the output should be:
FAIL
PASS
FAIL
FAIL
